## Project Overview

This portfolio website is designed to showcase my skills and project experience to potential employers and collaborators. The core feature is an interactive AI chatbot that can answer questions about my professional background, skills, and the projects I've worked on.

To achieve this, I designed and implemented a complete, secure, and scalable technical architecture that covers frontend interaction, a backend proxy layer, and the core AI service.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Interactive AI Assistant**: An intelligent chatbot built with Flowise and powered by the OpenAI API, capable of understanding natural language and providing relevant information.
* **Bilingual (English/Chinese) Support**: Client-side i18n (internationalization) implemented with JavaScript, allowing visitors to switch languages seamlessly.
* **Responsive Web Design (RWD)**: Ensures a consistent and optimal viewing experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Secure API Key Management**: Utilizes a Cloudflare Worker as a secure proxy server to protect backend API keys from being exposed on the frontend.
